# Freatures:
  - Functional touchpad;
  - Customizable doubleclick and hold actions(using ui-editor);
  - Haptic feedback(in the future will prrobably be customizable);
  - Anything can be changed using the ui-editor;
  - Every icon can be changed trought the editor;
  - Holding on volume or channel buttons will trigger the action repeteadly untill stop holding;
  - Double click or hold action can be a script or a automation and can be selected using the editor;

## note
  1) You must configure SamsungTV Smart custom component to make the card work(Needed)
  2) Create a separate view and set the visualisation type to panel(Recomended)
  3) No need to write any yaml,all settings available in the ui-editor(:sparkles:)
